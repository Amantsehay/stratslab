# Implement the Following Plan

Execute the spec/plan provided and report all work completed.

## Instructions

1. **Read the Plan**: Carefully read the entire spec to understand requirements
2. **Research**: Understand existing patterns and architecture before implementing
3. **Execute Steps**: Follow step-by-step tasks in the exact order specified
4. **Test Continuously**: Run validation commands after each phase
5. **Handle Errors**: If errors occur, debug and fix before proceeding
6. **Report Work**: Document all changes with git commits and final summary

## Key Principles

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in `stratslabapi/**`
- Use `poetry` commands, not `uv` (e.g., `poetry add` for dependencies)
- Create tests as you implement, not after
- Run validation commands frequently to catch issues early
- Make git commits for logical chunks of work
- If spec needs updating, update it and note the changes
