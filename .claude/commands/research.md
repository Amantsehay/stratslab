# Codebase Research

Execute structured codebase exploration to understand architecture, patterns, and conventions. Create findings in `specs/research/*.md`.

## Instructions

- You're conducting research to understand a specific aspect of the codebase
- Create research findings in the `specs/research/*.md` file with a descriptive name
- Use the `.claude/templates/research-spec.md` template as your guide
- Explore the codebase systematically to answer research questions
- Document patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
- Identify key components and how they relate
- Record findings in a structured format for future reference
- Focus on understanding, not implementing

## Research Scope

Focus on these file types and locations:
- `README.md` - Project overview and context
- `stratslabapi/**` - Backend API implementation
- `tests/**` - Test patterns and structure
- `.claude/**` - Workflow and command documentation

## Plan Format

Use the `.claude/templates/research-spec.md` template as your guide. Key sections:

1. **Research Objective** - What is being researched and why
2. **Research Questions** - Specific questions to answer
3. **Scope** - What is included and excluded
4. **Exploration Plan** - Phased approach (Foundation → Deep Dive → Analysis)
5. **Step by Step Tasks** - Detailed exploration steps
6. **Key Findings** - Architecture, patterns, conventions, strengths, weaknesses
7. **Insights & Recommendations** - Key insights and future recommendations
8. **Documentation Summary** - What was discovered and documented

## Important Notes

- Be systematic and thorough in your exploration
- Document what you find, not just what you think
- Look for patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
- Understand why things are designed the way they are
- Identify strengths to maintain and weaknesses to address
- Create findings that help others understand the codebase
